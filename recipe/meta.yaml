  summary: Tensor product B-spline fitting and evaluation
  description: |
    Detector response to a high-energy physics process is often estimated by
    Monte Carlo simulation. For purposes of data analysis, the results of this
    simulation are typically stored in large multi-dimensional histograms,
    which can quickly become unwieldy in terms of size or numerically
    problematic due to unfilled bins or interpolation artifacts. Photospline is
    a library that uses the penalized spline technique to efficiently compute,
    store, and evaluate B-spline representations of such tables.
